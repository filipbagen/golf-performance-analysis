    "## Description\n",
    "This is the final project within the course Sports Analytics, TDDE64, at Link√∂ping University which analyzes the impact of various golf performance metrics on player outcomes using machine learning techniques and regression analysis. The dataset contains pga tour player data from 2010-2017.\n",

    "#### Can we determine the most important features that affect a golfer's Average Score and predict the Average Score of a golfer based on their performance metrics?\n",

    "### 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "pgatour_cleaned.csv contains 11 columns. Each row indicates a golfer's performance for that year.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Name**: Name of the golfer\n",
    "- **Rounds**: Number of PGA tour rounds played in that year by that particular player.\n",
    "- **Scoring**: Average score per round played for that year.\n",
    "- **Driving Distance**: Average drive distance is calculated from two holes per round, chosen to negate wind effects. The measurement ends where the drive stops, regardless of fairway placement.\n",
    "- **FWY_%**: The percentage of time a tee shot comes to rest in the fairway (regardless of club)\n",
    "- **GIR_%**: Green in Regulation (GIR) percentage is the frequency a player's ball touches the green after the GIR stroke, which is par minus two (1st stroke on par 3, 2nd on par 4, 3rd on par 5).\n",
    "- **SG_P (Strokes gained putting)**: Strokes gained putting is calculated by comparing a player's putts from a specific distance to a baseline, subtracting the field average, and summing this for all holes. This total is then divided by the number of rounds played.\n",
    "- **SG_TTG (Strokes gained tee to green)**: Average per round of how a player's strokes compare to the field average for the same course and event, excluding strokes gained putting.\n",
    "- **SG_T (Strokes Gained Total)**: The per round average of the number of strokes the player was better or worse than the field average on the same course & event.\n",
    "- **Points**: FedExCup points earned.\n",
    "- **TOP_10**: Yearly count of a player's top 10 finishes\n",
    "- **1ST**: The number of wins the player had in that year.\n",
    "- **Year**: The year the data was collected.\n",
    "- **Money**: The amount of money the player earned in that year.\n",
    "- **Country**: Home country for player."
